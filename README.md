# Data-Science-Projects 

Projects I worked on while attending the Data Science Bootcamp at TripleTen.

| Project number | Title | Description |
|-----------------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Customer Churn Prediction | Built a classification model to predict customer churn, applied feature engineering and evaluated multiple algorithms including Logistic Regression and XGBoost. |
| 2 | Game Sales Analysis | Analyzed game sales data to identify patterns and trends in global video game markets using statistical tests and visualizations. |
| 3 | Predicting Gold Recovery | Developed a supervised machine learning model to predict gold recovery rates in ore processing using regression models, achieving 7.93% weighted sMAPE on final evaluation. |
