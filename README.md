# Data Science Projects

| Project | Title | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **AI Data Science Assistant** | Created a custom AI assistant capable of answering questions about datasets and generating exploratory insights using natural language queries, powered by large language models and LangChain with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). |
| 2 | **Customer Age Prediction from Images** | Built a scalable deep learning pipeline using TensorFlow and Keras to estimate customer age from facial images, leveraging image preprocessing, augmentation, model tuning, and GPU acceleration on Google Colab for efficient model training. |
| 3 | **Customer Churn Prediction** | Built a classification model to predict customer churn using feature engineering, class imbalance handling, and multiple algorithms including Logistic Regression and XGBoost (AUC–ROC 0.94). |
| 4 | **Game Sales Analysis** | Analyzed global video game sales data to identify platform trends, score-to-sales correlations, and regional genre preferences using hypothesis testing and data visualization. |
| 5 | **Predicting Gold Recovery** | Developed a supervised regression model to forecast gold recovery rates in ore processing, applying feature engineering and model tuning to achieve weighted sMAPE 7.93% on unseen test data. |
